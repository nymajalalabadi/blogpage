Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. Learn the basics and start building today!

## What is Vue.js?

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It's designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use as much or as little of it as you need.

## Core Features

### Reactive Data Binding

Vue's reactivity system automatically tracks dependencies and updates the DOM when data changes. This makes it easy to keep your UI in sync with your application state.

### Component System

Vue applications are built around components - reusable, self-contained pieces of UI. Components can be simple or complex, and they can be composed together to build entire applications.

### Vue CLI

The Vue CLI provides a full system for rapid Vue.js development. It provides:
- Project scaffolding
- Plugin system
- Development server with hot reload
- Build tools for production

## Getting Started

![Next.js File Based Routing](/images/posts/getting-started-with-nextjs4/nextjs-file-based-routing.png)

To create a new Vue project, install the Vue CLI and create a project:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create my-vue-app
```

## Single File Components

Vue's single file components (.vue files) allow you to define the template, script, and styles for a component all in one file, making development more organized and maintainable.

## Ecosystem

Vue has a rich ecosystem including:
- Vue Router for routing
- Vuex for state management
- Vue CLI for project scaffolding
- Official libraries for testing, SSR, and more
