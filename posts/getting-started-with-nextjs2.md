React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of React and how to get started with your first React application. Learn about components, state, and props.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Core Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of any React application. They are like JavaScript functions that accept inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### State

State is a way to store and manage data that can change over time in your React components. When state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state.

### Props

Props are inputs to components. They are passed from parent components to child components and are read-only.

## JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. It's not required for React, but it makes your code more readable and easier to write.

## Getting Started

To create a new React app, you can use Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

This will set up a new React project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.
