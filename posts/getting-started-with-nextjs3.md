Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Let's dive into Angular and build something amazing! We'll cover components, services, and routing.

## What is Angular?

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript and provides a robust framework for developing scalable web applications.

## Key Features

### Components

Components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. Each component consists of:
- An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
- A TypeScript class that defines behavior
- CSS styles that define the appearance

### Services

Services are classes that contain business logic and can be shared across components. They help in separating concerns and making your code more maintainable.

### Routing

Angular's router enables navigation from one view to another as users perform tasks in your application. It updates the browser URL and manages component loading.

## Getting Started

To create a new Angular project, install the Angular CLI and run:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-angular-app
```

## Architecture

Angular applications are structured as a set of modules, components, services, and other building blocks that work together to create a cohesive application.
